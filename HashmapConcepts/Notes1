How Hashmap works internally?

Hashmap is an associative array data structure which stores data as key value pair.Hashmap works on the basis of Hashing

Hashcode of null is always zero.

Hashmap is not synchronized(not thread safe).

#LinkedHashMap(c) extends HashMap(c) and these both implements Map Interface. 
-> It maintains insertion order

1-Insertion Order:It stores the value in a node (Doubly linked list) 
2-key value pair
3-Not synchronized i.e not thread safe
4-one null key and multi[ple null vlaues are allowed.
